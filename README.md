# Project Title

## Overview

This project consists of three parts focusing on data analysis and text processing. Each part explores different methodologies and techniques for handling and analyzing data efficiently.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following Jupyter notebooks:

1. **HW1.ipynb** - Introduction to data analysis, exploring fundamental techniques and concepts.
2. **HW2.ipynb** - Advanced data manipulation and processing methods.
3. **text-analysis.ipynb** - Focuses on text processing and analysis using various techniques.

To run the notebooks, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (if applicable)
- NLTK / SpaCy (for text analysis, if required)

You can install the necessary dependencies using:
